**Inspiration Starts at Home**

We’ve all done it. As parents, we often find ourselves sharing stories of extraordinary people with our children. "Shubhanshu Shukla is the first Indian astronaut to go to the International Space Station. If he can do it, why can’t you?" Or, "Vaibhav Suryavanshi is only 13 years old and already playing in the IPL. What about that pani puri seller’s daughter who became an IAS officer?" The list goes on.

But have you ever stopped to think about the impact of these stories? You might wonder, "What’s wrong with sharing these tales of grit and determination? If I don’t, what will inspire my children?" The answer is simple: **You**. Inspiration starts at home.

From a very young age, children observe, absorb, and learn from their parents and family members. So, take a moment to reflect on your habits and behaviors at home. If you’re constantly scrolling through your phone at the dining table or before bed, telling your children not to do the same because it’s bad for their health won’t mean much.

Consider the examples you set. Do you lie, cheat, or break rules in front of your children? How do you treat others? If you bad-mouth your separated spouse or disrespect relatives in front of your kids, they’re learning to do the same.

A common concern among parents is that their child doesn’t study or lacks focus and dedication. While the solution may not be straightforward, a good starting point is to assess your own behavior.

- How often does your child see you reading a book or learning something new? Do they see you trying, failing, and trying again, or do you quit at the first sign of difficulty?
- Is your home environment conducive to reading, writing, and learning, or is it noisy, messy, and full of distractions?
- Do you have conversations about your own school life, study habits, and academic or co-curricular achievements and failures?
- Do you talk about the journey one has to go on to achieve their goals, emphasizing the importance of following the right process? Often, we focus on achievements but neglect to share stories of failures and sacrifices.
- Are small achievements celebrated in your home, or do only big milestones get mentioned?

If you’ve addressed these points and still don’t see any change, it might be time to look deeper. Consider your child’s interests, natural talents, peer group, teachers, school environment, and other factors that might be affecting their mindset. More on these in future write-ups.

Remember, as parents, our actions create lasting impressions on our children’s personalities. You might feel stressed or wonder, "Can I ever be a normal, erring human in front of my kids?" The answer is yes, you can and should be!

To create a psychologically safe environment at home, try these tips:

- When a mistake happens, talk about it with your child.
- Gather lessons learned.
- Discuss hard boundaries that cannot be crossed and the consequences if they are.

In parenting, there are no perfect answers. What works for one family may not work for another. However, a parent’s values, choices, actions, and reactions profoundly affect how a child views and accepts the world. So, the next time you’re tempted to share an inspirational story, first ask yourself: Does my child have an environment that allows inspiration to flow and be received?
